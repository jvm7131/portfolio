       <h1> Reflective Essay of GitHub and PSU Website</h1>
        <p><b>Most significant challenges on a new learner</b></p>
       <p> One of the challenges I experienced while using GitHub was figuring out what is the
        best code to use to improve my website to make it look as creative and nice as I want. It
        was a bit difficult at times but with the help of DR. B and using w3schools I was able to
        figure it out. A challenge I faced using the PSU website is remembering to save my changes.
        Once I had exited from the website and forgot to save and I had to redo everything so, since
        I had kept in mind to make sure to click update after I change something.</p>
      <p><b>  Advantages of GitHub Vs PSU website An advantage</b></p>
        <p>I had with GitHub is that I have more creative freedom. I am able use CSS and different codes to design and choose how I want the layout of my website
        to look like. It is a bit difficult at times being that if I mess up my code it may mess up
        my website and I will have to figure out my mistake to fix it. This can also be good because
        then if I make that mistake again, I will know what to do to fix it. The advantage with PSU
        websites is that itâ€™s pretty simple. It has many layouts and styles to choose from, so it is
        easy to customize your website. It is also easy to add things to my website.</p>
      <p>  <b> Skills necessary to develop website and skills I want to improve on both websites</b></p>
        <p>Skills I think are important to have while using GitHub are problem solving because you will be ready for
        any problem that may happen so you can be prepared to find a solution for it. Being having
        the willingness to learn being that you will need to learn different skill to improve your
        website. Patience because you need to be able to take the time to apply your code to your
        website. Skills that are important for PSU website is adaptability because it is different
        from Git Hub so switching from that you would have to be open to learning the tools to
        create your website on PSU website. Problem solving skills are also important here because
        you may receive errors on the PSU website, and you will have to figure out the issues so it
        will go away. The skill I want to improve on is my problem-solving skills so that I can
        handle challenges better</p>
